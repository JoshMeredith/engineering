It also means that a cross-compiling GHC could build plugins for its host platform in addition to building code for its target platform.\\n* A side-effect of the previous bullet is that primops\u2019 types are now platform independent. Previously some of them would use Word64 on 32-bit architectures and Word on 64-bit architectures: now Word64 is used on every platform. A side-effect of this side-effect is that we had to make Word64 as efficient as Word: it now benefits from the same optimizations (constant folding [#19024](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19024), etc.). On 32-bit platforms, it reduced allocations by a fair amount in some cases: e.g. -25.8% in T9203 test and -11.5% when running haddock on base library \\\\[[!6167](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/6167)\\\\].

The root cause of the issue couldn\u2019t be easily solved so we modified GHC\u2019s build system to avoid the use of these auxiliary files, bypassing the issue.
